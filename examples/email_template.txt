Subject: Quick question about {{company}}'s customer feedback workflow

Hi {{name}},

I’m Bish from Cxplus.ai. We help teams like {{company}} extract themes + sentiment from customer reviews and support tickets, and turn them into product & CS actions.

If you’re the right owner for customer feedback tooling at {{company}}, I’d love to share a 2-minute overview and see if it’s relevant.

Best,
Bish
